  Convert ROSPY Scripts to C++
   
   benefits:
   
    Performance: C++ generally offers better performance compared to Python, especially for computationally intensive tasks.
    Memory Efficiency: C++ provides more control over memory management, which can be crucial for resource-constrained robots.
    Reduced ROS Overhead: Direct interaction with ROS libraries in C++ can bypass some ROSpy abstraction layers, potentially improving efficiency.
