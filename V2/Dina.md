#  What's Next

## Week 11 - 12:

- **Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm Implementation**
  - To help robots navigate in dynamic environments by detecting obstacles and planning safe trajectories to avoid collisions.

- **Converting Python Publishing Scripts to C++**
  - For better memory management, faster execution speed, and more control providing which are crucial for real-time applications in robotics.

- **Improving Odometry Performance**
  - We aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of robot localization, leading to more precise navigation and mapping capabilities.

## Week 13:

- **Focusing on the final presentation's documentaion**
