## Mobile Application

### Used Technologies:
* **React Native**
  > React Native is a React JS-based framework to design mobile apps with reusable components.

* **EXPO**
  > Simplified Development Experience Expo is a framework and platform for building React Native applications.
  > It aims to provide a simplified development experience by abstracting away some of the complexities involved in setting up and
  > configuring a React Native project.
  >
  > Advantages of Expo:
  > ------------------
  > **1. Quick Start:**
  >
  >    Expo allows you to quickly start developing your app without worrying about device-specific setup or native code dependencies.
  >
  > **2. Over-the-Air Updates:**
  >
  >    With Expo, you can deploy updates to your app directly to user devices without requiring them to download a new version from the app store.
  >
  > **3. Access to Pre-built Libraries:**
  >   
  >    Expo provides a wide range of pre-built libraries and APIs, making it easy to add features like push notifications, in-app purchases, and maps to your app.
  >
  > **4. Simplified Build Process:**
  >
  >    Expo handles the build process for you, abstracting away the need to configure build tools and deal with native code compilation.
  >
  > **5. Native Physical Device:**
  >
  >    With Expo, you can have the Expo Go app installed in your mobile and connect over the same network and get your app tested on any physical device [both Android and iOS].
