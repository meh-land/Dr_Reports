> TypeScript is often considered better than JavaScript for several reasons, especially in the context of large-scale or complex applications.
>
> Here are some key advantages of TypeScript over JavaScript:
> -----------------------------------------------------------
> * **Optional Static Typing:**
>
> JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning that the software will not treat type differences as errors up until runtime.
> This often resulted in a lot of bugs and frustration. However, TypeScript offers optional static typing. Once static typing is declared,
> a variable does not change its type and can only take in certain values. The compiler alert developers of any type-related errors
> which results in early bug detection.
>
> * **Early Bug Detection:**
>
> With the compiler checking our code, warnings and errors caught for us at the time of development, decreasing the chances of bugs and
> unexpected behavior at runtime. Checking type correctness at compile time also helps with refactoring code quickly with confidence.
> Overall, this feature helps avoid accidental mistakes that developers otherwise would have to comb through manually in JavaScript.
>
> * **Improved Readability:**
>
> Defined types and clear categories for variable declarations not only improve readability, but the stability of the code overall.
