# Overview
In the past weeks we’ve been searching for controlling our robot’s motors with ROS as it’s more compatible with the rest of the layers we’re dealing with. 
First, we’re controlling speed of the DC motor of the prototype with PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) which its main idea is that it turns the digital signal into an analog signal by changing the timing of how long it stayed ON and OFF which measured by “duty cycle” parameter that used to describe the percentage of how long it stayed ON compared to how long it stayed OFF.
